# How to Add a New Release on GitHub

To add a new release to your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**: Go to the main page of your repository on GitHub.

2. **Access Releases**: Click on the "Releases" section, found to the right of the list of files.

3. **Draft New Release**: Click on "Draft a new release" at the top of the Releases section.

4. **Tag Your Release**: Use the "Choose a tag" dropdown to select an existing tag or create a new one for your release.

5. **Target Branch**: If you've created a new tag, select the target branch for your release using the "Target" dropdown menu.

6. **Release Title**: Enter a title for your release in the "Release title" field.

7. **Describe Your Release**: Add a detailed description for your release in the "Describe this release" text area.

8. **Attach Binaries (Optional)**: If applicable, attach binary files such as compiled programs by dragging and dropping or manually selecting files.

9. **Mark as Pre-Release (Optional)**: If the release is not final, mark it as a pre-release by checking "This is a pre-release."

10. **Publish or Save Draft**: Click "Publish release" to make your release public. Alternatively, click "Save draft" to save the release and continue working on it later.

Remember, you need to have write permissions to the repository to manage releases. For more detailed instructions, you can visit the GitHub documentation on [Managing releases in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
